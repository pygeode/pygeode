Description: PyGeode is a software library intended to simplify the management, analysis,
        and visualization of gridded geophysical datasets such as those generated by
        climate models. The library provides three main advantages. Firstly, it can
        define a geophysical coordinate system for any given dataset, and allows
        operations to be carried conceptually in this physical coordinate system, in
        a way that is independent of the native coordinate system of a particular
        dataset. This greatly simplifies working with datasets from different
        sources. Secondly, the library allows mathematical operations to be performed
        on datasets which fit on disk but not in memory; this is useful for dealing
        with the extremely large datasets generated by climate models, and permits
        operations to be performed over networks. Finally, the library provides tools
        for visualizing these datasets in a scientifically useful way. The library is
        written in Python, and makes use of a number of existing packages to perform
        the underlying computations and to create plots.
