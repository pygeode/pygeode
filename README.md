PyGeode is a python package intended to simplify the manipulation, analysis and
visualization of geophysical datasets, such as those generated by climate
models. It is particularly suited to dealing with large datasets that donâ€™t fit
into memory. It is also intended to simplify plotting this data with
matplotlib. For more information, see the package documentation or sample
Binder notebooks.
