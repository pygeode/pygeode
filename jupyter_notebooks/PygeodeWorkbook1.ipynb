    "The remainder of this short course will introduce `pygeode`, a Python package designed for accessing, processing, and visualizing gridded geophysical data. It is an alternative to `xarray` or to `IRIS`. PyGeode uses `numpy` and `matplotlib` extensively for underlying computations and plotting, and is designed around three main principles: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data should be represented and manipulated in geophysical coordinates, not in array indices\n",
    "2. Data should be 'lazy-loaded', i.e. left on disk until needed for computation, and then accessed in a memory-friendly way\n",
    "3. Plotting defaults should be as close to publication quality as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Full documentation about pygeode including a tutorial, gallery, and API reference, can be found at [pygeode.github.io](https://pygeode.github.io).\n",
