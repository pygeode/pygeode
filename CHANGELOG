1.0.0 - 2014/04/14

  General updates to the code:
  - Converted C shared libraries to Python extension modules, to improve
    portability of the package.
  - New top-level "open" and "save" commands, which guess the appropriate file
    format to use.

  Updates to Var class:
  - Change the behaviour of Var.__getitem__, so that degenerate axes are
    removed.  This brings our array slicing behaviour closer to numpy.

  Updates to axis module:
  - For axes, added in a tolerance autodetection for closeness of matches,
    based on spacing in axis.
  - New functions "regularlat" & "regularlon" to create regularly spaced
    latitude and longitude axes.

  New modules:
  - New 'spectral' module, which defines a Spectral axis.

  Updates to the plot module:
  - Can output to PDF.
  - Improved support for Basemap.
  - Support for scatter plots, quiver plots, and significance masks.
  - Various usability improvements

  Updates to the old (v1) plot module:
  - Added hatching option for old significance mask.

  Updates to the stats module:
  - Added option to scale effective degrees of freedom in regress().
  - Regress now takes a comma-separated string to specify outputs, like EOF.
  - New function "multiple_regress" - code to do multiple linear regression.

  Updates to the reduce module:
  - Added argmin() operator.

  Updates to the ufunc module:
  - We now keep the original variable name if we're doing an arithmetic scalar
    operation on the variable.

  Updates to the formats.cfmeta module:
  - Better detection and handling of (malformed) time axes.

  Bug fixes:
  - Correct portability issue with timeaxiscore module; also improved its error 
    reporting.
  - Fixed issue with concatenating along dummy axis.
  - Fixed issue with "smooth" module (issue 44), and changed the smooth
    interface a bit to make it easier to use your own kernels.


0.7.3 - 2014/01/13
  - Add support for more netcdf data types (issue 54).
  - Minor bugfix for ufunc (var name was not being set properly).

0.7.2 - 2013/09/16
  - Fix ufunc operators dropping metadata (issue 39).

0.7.1 - 2013/06/05
  - Fix missing header message in progress bars (issue 33).
  - Fix axis values being overwritten in plotvar (issue 36).

0.7.0 - 2012/08/17

  Updates to Var and Axis classes:
  - Vars now have a 'units' attribute
  - Vars and Axes now have a 'plotatts' dictionary, which contains all plotting 
    parameters.  Some possible keys are:
      plottitle   - The title to use for plots of this variable (or the axis
                    label, if this is an Axis)
      plotname    - A shorter title, used for axis labels.
      plotunits   - The units of the variable (overrides the 'units' attribute
                    of the variable).
      plotscale   - The type of scaling to apply to the values, either 'linear'
                    or 'log'.
      plotorder   - The direction to plot the axis coordinates.  1 = away from
                    origin, -1 = towards origin.
      formatstr   - A special string for formatting the values on axis ticks
                    and plot titles.
      scalefactor - unit conversion, to get values in the plotunits
      offset      - unit conversion, to get values in the plotunits
  - Auto-completion of axis & variable members of Var and Dataset objects
    (works in ipython).  These members are also listed in dir() calls now.

  Updates to the plot module:
  - Added 'every' keyword to plotquiver() to thin the vector field, implemented 
    lblx, lbly kwargs.
  - In plotsigmask(), added "alpha" kwarg to control alpha value of mask
  - Keyword arguments "scaleAx", "scaleX", "scaleY" control scaling the values
    by one of the axis coordinates.  This preserves integrals under a
    logarithmic axis.
  - added log10-scaling of 2D field values with new kwarg 'logVal'
  - apply scalefactor and offset from plotatts, if they're defined.  Only
    triggers if var.plotatts['plotunits'] is different from var.units.
  - disable anti-aliasing in 2D plots.  In some versions of matplotlib (e.g.
    the one shipped with Ubuntu 11.10), antialiasing causes annoying gaps
    between polygons in various plots (contourf, pcolor, etc.).
  - Created a more modularized set of plotting routines.  This gives greater
    control over the construction of the plots, e.g. for publication.  The old
    'plotvar' routine is still available for cases where the automatic
    formatting is good enough.

  Updates to the stats module:
  - Added some t test code:
      difference(X, Y) - Calculates difference between the mean values of X
                         and Y averaged over the dimensions specified by axes.
                         Returns X - Y, p values, confidence intervals, and
                         degrees of freedom.
      isnonzero(X)     - Determines if X is non-zero, assuming X is normally
                         distributed.  Returns mean of X along axes, p value,
                         and confidence interval.
  - Updated regress() to work on arbitrary axes
  - can now specify which axes to correlate()
  - correlate() now works with NaN values.

  Updates to the timeutils module:
  - Lag variable for lagged correlations
  - Moved _uniquify, modify, reltime, delta, wrapdate, and date_diff from
    timeaxis module to timeutils module.
  - New operator removeleapyears() to convert a standard time axis to a 365-day
    or 360-day axis.
  - New operator splittimeaxis() to split a time axis into 2 dimensions (e.g.
    year, day-of-year).
  - New function conform_values() to make 2 time axes have the same units and
    start date.
  - New operator jointimeaxes() to convert a 2D time representation (e.g. year,
    day-of-year) to a single time axis.

  Other updates:
  - Interpolation now is nan-aware and can extrapolate linearly.  By default,
    no extrapolation is done (gives NaNs outside the data range).
  - Improved compatibility with newer versions of the progressbar package.
  - In concat module, allow the concatenation axis to be specified by the user,
    so it doesn't have to be guessed.
  - Added argmax() operator (works on one dimension)
  - In composite operator, events that extend past the edge of the data now are
    filled with NaNs
  - Improved handling of endpoints in the 'smooth' operator.
